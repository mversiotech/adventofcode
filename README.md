Advent of Code 2023
===================

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
challenges of 2023. I like to use this yearly event as an opportunity to play
around with various programming languages. For this year, I am going to write
in [D](https://dlang.org).

Self-imposed rules
------------------

* Write in D, stdlib only, no third-party packages
* No cheap shortcuts like hard coded input data

Previous years
