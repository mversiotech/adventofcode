Advent of Code 2022
===================

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
challenges of 2022.  My main goal for this year (besides having fun) is to learn
the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language.

Self-imposed rules
------------------

* Write in Nim, stdlib only, no third-party packages
* When in doubt, prefer idiomatic solutions to highly optimized ones
* No cheap shortcuts like hard coded input data
* Identify and correctly handle all error cases

Older Events

I have first tried AOC in 2022, but I'd like to try some of the older puzzles
too. I am going to use a different language for each year. Currently in progress:
